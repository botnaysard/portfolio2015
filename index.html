					<p>
						The first time I made a web page, it was using Windows '98 and text edit on a blistering fast Pentium II 350 (it was actually a really fast machine for its time).  
					</p>
					<p>
						Since those glorious days, I've had many adventures taken a few detours: liberal arts grad school, several years of making public policy, parenthood, and pug ownership.  A few years older and wiser, I've found my way back to creating online with the same sense of excitement that I felt in my parents basement all those years ago.  
					</p>
					<p>
						I tend strongly towards minimalist design.  This means that a lot of rooms in my house are white or grey, and that there are no visible cables in my workspace. I really appreciate negative space. Naturally, this ethos carries over to the things I create.  I put a lot of effort into ensuring that each and every element of a design is carefully considered and purposeful.  This is especially true when it comes to animation.
					</p>
					<p>
						My creative toolbox presently includes: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, javascript, and jQuery.
